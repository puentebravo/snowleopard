    <h1>All about Snow Leopards</h1>

    <p>
      Snow Leopards are some of the world's most elusive hunters. Mostly found
      at higher elevations, they are uniquely adapted to their cold, mountainous
      terrain.

    <p>
      Snow Leopards are more than just adapted for the cold; they're perfect for
      hunting the unsually skittish prey they stalk up high. In addition to
      their natural camouflage, snow leopards have an incredible horizontal
      leap; they're capable of reaching targets over 20 feet away in a single
      bound. If one of these alpine creatures gets the jump on you, it's pretty
      much over.
